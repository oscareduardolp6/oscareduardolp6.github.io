This has led me to pay much more attention to the nutritional information of my meals and to have greater control over my daily intake. However, like any developer, I don&amp;rsquo;t want to spend too much time consistently doing these tasks.

This time I want to share how I organize my notes and the things I learn. Personally, I am a software developer, so I have a specific space for the knowledge and resources I gather about technologies that interest me, and since that&amp;rsquo;s my most &amp;ldquo;nourished&amp;rdquo; space, it will be the one I use as an example.</description></item></channel></rss>
