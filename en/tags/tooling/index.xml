Many times, if I don&amp;rsquo;t structure it very well, I won&amp;rsquo;t remember how I saved it and will end up losing it anyway. This is a big part of why I like Obsidian so much as a tool; it allows me to structure things in a way very similar to how I do it mentally, meaning in relationships.</description></item><item><title>üìä Obsidian: Nutrition</title><link>https://oscarlp6.dev/en/blogs/nutrition-system-obsidian/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://oscarlp6.dev/en/blogs/nutrition-system-obsidian/</guid><description>Although I am not a fitness enthusiast, this year I have committed to improving my health. This has led me to pay much more attention to the nutritional information of my meals and to have greater control over my daily intake.

This time, I want to delve into how I structure and advance in my projects, managing the tasks to be performed and those that arise along the way. As a developer, but also as an individual committed to achieving goals in various areas of my life, I have devised a system that allows me to maintain control and a global vision of each project, from its conception to its completion.</description></item></channel></rss>
