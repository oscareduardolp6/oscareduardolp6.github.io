Beyond the specificities of functional programming like Monads, I’ve been fascinated by concepts related to typing, such as Union Types and the utilities they bring.
Among these utilities, I’ve learned the concept of making invalid states unrepresentable. This means avoiding methods like isX and, instead of having to constantly check those conditions, knowing through the simple type system that your state is valid or invalid.</description></item><item><title>The Reader Monad in Action 📖</title><link>https://oscarlp6.dev/en/blogs/exploring-reader-monad/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Jan 2024 19:00:00 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://oscarlp6.dev/en/blogs/exploring-reader-monad/</guid><description>📖 My Experience with the Reader Monad I embarked on what seemed like a trivial but profoundly educational side project. My task: to build a tool for managing inventories, sales, and purchases in a store. However, beyond the apparent simplicity of the project, my true purpose lies in delving into two technologies that have captured my attention remarkably: functional programming and Next.js.
🌐 Introduction This project serves as a canvas where I can apply and refine my knowledge in functional programming, a paradigm that offers a unique perspective on tackling software problems.</description></item></channel></rss>
