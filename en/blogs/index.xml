It&amp;rsquo;s always been a form of personal catharsis for me, where I document my emotions, concerns, and feelings. However, lately, it has evolved, thanks to tools like Obsidian, into what many might call a &amp;ldquo;second brain.&amp;rdquo; Even before, Obsidian was defined as such, a tool for your second brain. Though I&amp;rsquo;m not fond of the term, it&amp;rsquo;s a fact that it&amp;rsquo;s an extremely powerful tool.</description></item><item><title>The Reader Monad in Action üìñ</title><link>https://oscarlp6.dev/en/blogs/exploring-reader-monad/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Jan 2024 19:00:00 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://oscarlp6.dev/en/blogs/exploring-reader-monad/</guid><description>üìñ My Experience with the Reader Monad I embarked on what seemed like a trivial but profoundly educational side project. My task: to build a tool for managing inventories, sales, and purchases in a store. However, beyond the apparent simplicity of the project, my true purpose lies in delving into two technologies that have captured my attention remarkably: functional programming and Next.js.
üåê Introduction This project serves as a canvas where I can apply and refine my knowledge in functional programming, a paradigm that offers a unique perspective on tackling software problems.</description></item><item><title>Working Under Pressure ü§Ø</title><link>https://oscarlp6.dev/en/blogs/working-underpressure/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Dec 2023 17:00:00 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://oscarlp6.dev/en/blogs/working-underpressure/</guid><description>ü§Ø I Don&amp;rsquo;t Like Working Under Pressure As a remote developer in a company with a strong culture, I must admit that over time, I have lost the taste for working under pressure. I remember in my previous job, pressure was the norm, with tight deadlines and projects deviating completely from estimations. A stark contrast to how I handle things now.

Although that day does come, because I like to keep my desktop organized, I think it&amp;rsquo;s a task that I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have to do myself, but that I can automate.</description></item></channel></rss>
