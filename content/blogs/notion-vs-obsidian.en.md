Before implementing my entire [productivity system](https://oscarlp6.dev/en/blogs/obsidian-introduction/) and [journaling](https://oscarlp6.dev/en/blogs/obsidian-journaling/) in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), I *experimented* with several other tools. One of the most *notable* ones is [Notion](https://www.notion.com/es), an impressive and highly *customizable* tool. However, today I will *explore* why I believe it is not the best *option* for productivity systems or things like a *second brain*.

## üí° Organization of ideas and thoughts
Since I was in *school*, I always had *difficulties* taking notes because I felt that the way we think is not well *aligned* with how we often take notes. When you study a topic in *school*, a *concept* is often related to other things you probably already *know*. So, if you looked at my notes, you would always see many *arrows* crossing the page because, for me, it was very *important* to know that *concept 1* is related to or connected with *concept A*. That is why, for me, *Obsidian* is one of the tools I like the most, because the idea of *linking concepts* is part of its philosophy. And I think this is the aspect that makes it *stand out* the most compared to other *note-taking apps* like **Notion**. While in **Notion**, you can also *link* things, it is a fact that it is not as *straightforward* as in *Obsidian*. Moreover, the *philosophy* of **Notion** is not geared toward creating *relationships* between notes. That‚Äôs fine, but, at least for my *purposes*, it was not what I wanted. For this reason, I think **Notion** does not perform well when it comes to creating *knowledge bases*.

## üîë Data ownership
One of the greatest advantages of *Obsidian* is that you are the *owner* of your information. Even though there are services like *Sync* to synchronize your data across devices, all the knowledge, ideas, projects, etc., that you have in *Obsidian* are stored as *files* on your device. This means that if *Obsidian* decides to change its *business model* tomorrow and becomes a paid service, you would not need to worry about *migrating* your information since you already have it stored as *Markdown* files on your device.

This gives you a lot of *flexibility* to try other tools that follow the same *philosophy*. It also provides peace of mind regarding the use of your information since, unless you use *Obsidian Sync* or something similar, the information never leaves your computer.

## üë®‚Äçüé® Format of the information
As I already mentioned, not only are you the owner of the information, but your notes are also in an *open* format that many other tools can use, often without requiring any adjustments. Additionally, by itself, it is already a *human-readable format*. It‚Äôs not like having your notes in `json` or `yml`.

## üîå Extensibility for developers
One of the aspects I love the most about *Obsidian* is its excellent *plugin* system, which allows the community to create *extensions* to address things that *Obsidian* does not completely solve. This gives you tremendous power to *adapt Obsidian* to your way of thinking or working. It offers much more freedom to decide how you want to *structure* your content. If you are a *developer* like me, it will be much *easier* to implement *systems* that help you keep records organized, extract information, etc. The possibilities are *endless*, but I believe it is much *easier* to achieve these kinds of systems with *Obsidian* than with **Notion**.

## ü´Ç Collaboration
Although I have focused on the advantages of **Obsidian**, I believe this is a point where it *definitely* falls short, as it is not even *integrated* into its *philosophy*.

If you want to share information with your team or have something that can be *collaborative*, it is very likely, at least from my point of view, that you will need to *explore* other possibilities. This is because it clashes with the nature of **Obsidian**, where files are stored on your computer. If you try to use it as a *collaborative solution*, you will face issues like *overlaps* in changes. For such cases, I think *Notion* shines. If you want to have a *CMS* or a *kanban* board for your team, that is where I would recommend using *Notion*.

## üìÉ Conclusion
In summary, both *Obsidian* and **Notion** have their strengths and weaknesses depending on the use case. *Obsidian* excels due to its philosophy centered on linking concepts, data ownership, and developer extensibility. However, it lacks robust features for team collaboration. On the other hand, **Notion** is better suited for collaborative environments, such as team boards and CMS-like systems. For this reason, my choice between the two depends on the context and the specific needs of the project or system I want to implement.
