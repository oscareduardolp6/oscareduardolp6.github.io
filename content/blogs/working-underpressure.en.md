# ðŸ¤¯ I Don't Like Working Under Pressure

As a remote developer in a company with a strong culture, I must admit that over time, I have lost the taste for working under _pressure_. I remember in my previous job, **pressure was the norm**, with tight deadlines and projects deviating completely from estimations. A stark contrast to how I handle things now.

In my early days of crafting my **resume**, I used to take pride in being able to work under pressure, and yes, I am... well, _effective_ in the sense that I might not do my best work under pressure, but at least I get the tasks done. Back then, I considered working under pressure a _virtue_, and to some extent, I still do. However, my relationship with this type of work environment has changed significantly. _Currently_, I greatly value the _incredible_ and **passionate** experience of working without the weight of pressure, allowing me to engage calmly and passionately in my tasks and thus achieve my best possible work.

In my current job, the _norm_ is to work calmly, with quite _reasonable_ deadlines and smooth communication to overcome any obstacles. However, due to a _special_ project, in the past few weeks, I've been forced to return to working under pressure. The task was to finish everything within a short timeframe because the client was eager to test the functionality. And I confess, I hate it. I know it's _inevitable_ in the job, but I believe my _perception_ that it's _desirable_ because it's _exciting_ has changed.

These days, I much prefer having all the time I need to conduct my _analysis_ calmly, review each step of the implementation without rushing to meet client expectations and beat the clock.

## ðŸ¤” Conclusion

In retrospect, my professional evolution has led me to reconsider the importance of working under pressure. Although it may have its exciting moments, I now value the quality and meticulous attention I can give to each task when not constrained by time pressure. It's a lesson that has transformed my work perspective and makes me question whether I should really include "ability to work under pressure" on my resume. The true skill lies in the ability to deliver exceptional performance even when there isn't a clock ticking every second.
